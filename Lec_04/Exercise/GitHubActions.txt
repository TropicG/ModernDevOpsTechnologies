* Superlinter

    Super-linter is an "all-in-one" automated tool designed to check your code for errors and consistency

    Key functions:
    - It identifies bugsm syntax errors or poor formatting before the code is even run
    - It has multi-language support
    - It is designed to be used as a GitHub Action

    Typically super linter is used as a separated job in GitHub actions:
    - Job 1 is building, compiling the code to make sure it works
    - Job 2 is linting, uses Super-linter to make sure the code is clean and follows professional standards

* Uploading and downloading artifacts in GitHubActions

    In GitHub Actions, every time a new job starts, it runs on a completely fresh virtual machine.
    This means files created in one job are deleted and not available to the next job. Artifacts are used to solve this problem

    Uploading Artifacts (actions/upload-artifact@v4)
    (actions/upload-artifact@v4) is a pre-made GitHub Action used to save and store files generated during a workflow run
    # This is used to save files so they persist after the job finishes
    - name: Upload a Build Artifact
      uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4 # Action to use
      with: # Parameters for the action
        name: my-artifact # Name of the artifact to upload. Optional. Default is 'artifact
        path: path/to/artifact/ # A file, directory or wildcard pattern that describes what to upload. Required.

    Downloading Artifacts(actions/download-artifact@v4)
    (actions/download-artifact@v4) is a pre-made GitHub Action used to retrieve files or folders (artifacts) that were previously saved using upload-artifact during a workflow run.
    # This is used to retrieve those saved files into a later job.
    - name: Download a single artifact # Name of the step
      uses: actions/download-artifact@v4 # Action to use
      with: # Parameters for the action
        name: my-artifact # Name of the artifact to download. Optional. If unspecified, all artifacts for the run are downloaded.
        path: path/to/download/artifact/     # Destination path. Supports basic tilde expansion.  # Optional. Default is $GITHUB_WORKSPACE

* Building DocketImages

    The goal is to automatically package your application as a Docker image and host it on the GitHub Container Registry

    There are required Variables in order for this to work:
    - github_username: Usualy set to ${{ github.actor }}, this is your Github username
    - github_password: Usually set to ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}, this is an automated token for authentication 
    - GIT_COMMIT: the specific commit hash being built
